Hello!
I'm writing this in hopes of getting my steem account verified. I apologize for the extremity of the situation, however I signed 
up more than 8 weeks ago. I have tried several times but no luck! Is there any way I can speed up this process? Been wanting to 
blog on Steem forever now! thanks!!! (gjiru21@gmail.com)
